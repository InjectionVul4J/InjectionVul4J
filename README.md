### InjectionVul4J is the artifact dataset that consists of a set of injection vulnerabilities attached with patches committed by their developers.

This dataset is at present used for evaluating the effectiveness of automated program repair toools, and also could boost other researches on injection vulnerabilites.

The three APR tools, which we have re-implemented to support the patch generation of InjectionVul4J, are also listed here to enable the replication of our experiments.

The POC/Exploit files is supplied to enable automated patch validation in the future.
